## Pivot longer

```{r}

# Import data
pulse_df = 
  read_sas("Data/public_pulse_data.sas7bdat") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

pulse_df

# Pivot longer
pulse_tidy = 
  pulse_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    bdi_score_bl:bdi_score_12m,
    names_to = "visit",
    # Get rid of bdi_score_ bit before the value for visit variable
    names_prefix = "bdi_score_",
    values_to = "bdi_score"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    # In this variable, look for every instance where variable == bl, and everywhere that condition is true, replace with 00m
    visit = replace(visit, visit == "bl", "00m"),
    # Often easier to think of categoricals as factors, rather than character variables
    visit = factor(visit)
  )

pulse_tidy
```

## Pivot wider

Make up a results data table

```{r}
analysis_df = 
  tibble(
    group = c("treatment", "treatment", "control", "control"),
    time = c("a", "b", "a", "b"),
    group_mean = c(4, 8, 3, 6)
  )
analysis_df

## Pivot wider

analysis_df %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "time",
    values_from = "group_mean"
  ) %>% 
  # Use format more human readable once knit
  knitr::kable()
```
